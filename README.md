# Gatsby Theme for Kenjdavidson.com

This will be the template for all projects moving forward, this will include (but not limited to):

* kenjdavidson.github.com
* jimbos nfl pools
* yahoo fantasy commish tools

## Projects

### Kenjdavidson.github.com

Articles, Information and CV.

### Jimbos NFL Pool

Just a small project I use so that my friends and I can get up to date details about weekly spread pools.

### Yahoo Fantasy Commish Tools

A couple of Yahoo leagues have some custom keeper rules that aren't maintained in Yahoo!  This project provides details to the players in these leagues and attempt to make my life easy so that I don't have to be answering questions all the time.

## Pitayan Gatsby Theme

I really like the minimalist style and will be basing the template off (gatsby-theme-pitayan)[https://github.com/Pitayan/gatsby-theme-pitayan] with some minor customizations:

* I don't need an Authors page, and will be removing this or at least hiding it from the current `DefaultLayout`
* The HomePage menu will be replaced with a site wide drop down/pop up menu based on a hamburger beside the dark/light theme.  This menu will mirror the footer menu.
